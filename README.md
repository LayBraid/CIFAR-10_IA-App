# CIFAR-10_IA-App :rocket:

This is an application to recognize images from the CIFAR-10 dataset

A Gradio integration is present. You can look at the usage section to know how to draw in the app or drag and drop images

The app will first download the dataset if not already done.

After, if this is the first time you run the app on your machine, the program will train the model.

# Usage

## To draw an image

```
./dataset_loader.py 1
```

## To drag and drop an image

```
./dataset_loader.py 2
```
